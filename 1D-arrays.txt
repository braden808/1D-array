Questions

You must give a short explanation for each answer.

1) Create a reference to an array of integers named "cat".
var cat = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(cat[2]);
3

The cat variable was created with brackets to create an array.  It was instructed to add integers so i added integers.  A console log was added to get the value of 3

2) What is the output of the following code fragment?
2 4
cat[0] = 2 and a space was added due to quotations, then cat[1] = 4

var cat = [2, 4, 6, 8];

console.log(cat[0] + " " + cat[1]);

3) What is the output of the following code fragment?

34 88 undefined

undefined

Two values were set from the array.  y[0] = 34 and y[1] = 88.  The reason that we got undefined on the last value is because there is no value for y[5] which makes it undefined.

var y = [ , , , , , , , , , ];

y[0] = 34;
y[1] = 88;

console.log(y[0] + " " + y[1] + " " + y[5]);

4) What is the output of the following code fragment?
1
When it's simplified you get zip[3].  zip[3] = 1

var zip = [7, 3, 4, 1, 9];

console.log(zip[2+1]);

5) What is the output of the following code fragment?
(7+3) undefined
10 undefined
undefined

There is no value for x[5]

var x = [7, 3, 4, , , , , , ];

console.log((x[0] + x[1]) + " " + x[5]);
